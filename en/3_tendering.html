        <p>As a public sector client, we have considerable leverage with our contractors to instill a safety culture
          throughout the entire procurement process. This approach encompasses: selection of tenders, stipulation of
          contract requirements, monitoring contractors’ performance, motivating those who perform well and sanctioning
          those who fail to fulfill their obligations. Contractors, as employers, must then effectively cascade the
          safety culture through the supply chain right down to the frontline workers on site.

        <p>Housing Authority (HA) selects competent contractors through list management. List management is to assess
          the qualifications and standard of performance of contractors which are compliance with ISO9001, ISO14001,
          ISO45001 and ISO50001 and adopting policies for ensuring safe and healthy working condition.<br>
          HA takes responsive actions for unsatisfactory safety performance, occurrence of serious accident or near miss

        <b>FINDINGS</b>
        <ul>
          <li>1. Main contractors are better than subcontractors in safety awareness. </li>
          <li>2. Management level have better safety awareness than workers. “Leading from the Top” is the most
            effective driving force in fostering site safety. </li>
          <li>3. Site personnel with better safety awareness sustained less injuries. </li>
          <li>4. Site personnel with better safety awareness have less frequency of breaching safety rules. </li>
          <li>5. Site personnel with longer service in the industry show lower safety awareness. This means the industry
            need to make more effort to improve the mindset of experienced personnel whereas the new comers to the
            industry show a higher tendency to follow safety rules. </li>
          <li>6. Site personnel with longer service in the construction company have better safety awareness. </li>
          <li>7. Site personnel taking care of more family members show better safety awareness. </li>

        <h2>Collaborative Learning</h2>
        <p>Safety Training Programmes have been provided for resident site supervisory staff, professional staff and
          resident site management staff. By integrating these programmes which fosters a culture where knowledge is
          shared across roles, teamwork is strengthened, and collective responsibility for safety is emphasized.
          Interactive and web-based elements further support engagement and empower staff at all levels to contribute to
          a safer working environment.
