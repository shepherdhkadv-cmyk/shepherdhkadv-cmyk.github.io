        <h2>Architectural Safety</h2>
        <p>The major hazardous areas for operation and maintenance in a building typically include the canopy, roof,
          re-entrant spaces, covered walkways on the building’s exterior, and the lift pit inside the building. To
          ensure safe operation and maintenance in these high-risk locations, appropriate safety measures are
          incorporated into the design, such as maintenance stairs, protective railings, gondolas, and maintenance
          platforms. These provisions facilitate safe access for maintenance workers and help reduce the risk of
          accidents. In addition to safe access for maintenance personnel, operational needs including material delivery
          and equipment handling should also be taken into consideration. Furthermore, a Maintenance and Repair (M&R)
          Access Plan must be prepared and submitted for approval prior to applying for consent to commence
          superstructure works. This plan ensures that all necessary access arrangements and safety features are in
          place to support ongoing maintenance activities safely and efficiently throughout the building’s lifecycle.

        <b>Safe Access to Canopy and Roof Top</b>
        <p>Water pipes are normally installed in canopy and re-entrant areas of domestic buildings. Safe access to these
          locations is typically provided from the lift lobby and corridors through the installation of staircases
          equipped with guardrails. In cases where direct access is obstructed on the floor with limited access, a steel
          platform is installed to ensure safe and convenient access for maintenance personnel.

        <b>Safe Access to Lift Pit </b>
        <p>
          Lifts require regular maintenance and inspections to ensure safe and reliable operation. At the lowest landing
          floor of every lift shaft, permanent anchorage points are installed to provide secure attachment for fall
          arrest systems and safety harnesses. These anchorage points are essential for protecting maintenance personnel
          when accessing the lift pit, significantly reducing the risk of falls and ensuring a safer working
          environment.
          <br>
          Furthermore, emergency stop switch inside lift shaft near the lift landing door of the lowest landing floor is
          also provided for the maintenance workers to stop the lift in order to avoid dangerous condition while working
          inside lift pit.

        <p>In addition, when the depth of a lift pit exceeds 2m, a staircase must be provided to ensure safe and
          convenient access for maintenance personnel. To prevent flooding in the lift pit, sump pits equipped with sump
          pumps and surface drainage channels are also installed. These safety measures help maintain a secure working
          environment by facilitating safe entry and exit, as well as protecting workers from hazards associated with
          water accumulation.</p>

        <b>Protection for Work at Height</b>
        <p>Protection against falls is one of the primary hazards prevention during maintenance and repair work on
          building façades and rooftops. To safeguard workers and prevent accidents, guardrails are installed along the
          edges of rooftops, flat roofs, and covered walkways. These protective barriers play a crucial role in creating
          a safe working environment by minimising the risk of falls from height.
          <br>
          In addition, essential provisions for the future installation of gondolas have been incorporated into the
          building design to facilitate safe maintenance of the façade. These include ensuring adequate structural
          strength for securely fixing clamps, providing facilities for tie-back anchors and safety ropes, and supplying
          electrical power to operate the gondola. These measures are critical to protecting maintenance workers by
          enabling safe and reliable access to the building exterior.

        <b>Air Conditioner Hood and Safe Maintenance Access</b>
        <p>Scaffolding work is often required when replacing or maintaining air conditioning (A/C) units in domestic
          flats, which poses significant risks of falls from height. To enhance worker safety and reduce these risks,
          A/C hood have been introduced for all domestic flat units, allowing installation and maintenance work to be
          performed safely from inside the flat. Additionally, the size of A/C windows has been enlarged to accommodate
          a wider range of A/C units and facilitate safer access. To further minimise risks associated with cleaning and
          repairing condensation pipes from the exterior, these pipes are designed to be positioned close to openable
          windows, enabling easier and safer access for maintenance personnel. These design considerations collectively
          improve safety by reducing the need for external scaffolding and providing safer, more convenient access
          points for workers. </p>

        <h2>Building Services Safety</h2>
        <b>Lighting Control for Enhances Accessibility</b>
        <p>Standard lighting illumination levels are provided throughout the public areas of domestic blocks to ensure
          general visibility and safety. To further enhance safety for residents and users with visual impairments, an
          adjustable lighting control system is installed. This system allows individuals to customise the lighting
          levels according to their needs, helping to reduce the risk of falls and improve overall accessibility and
          comfort within the building.
        </p>

            adjustable time delay.</p>
        </div>
        <b>Audible Lift Signals for Visually Impaired Users</b>
        <p>Users with visual impairments often face challenges when using lifts, particularly in knowing when the lift
          has arrived. To address this, audible signals and verbal announcements are provided to alert passengers of the
          lift car’s arrival and its direction of travel. These features significantly enhance safety and accessibility
          by ensuring that all users, including those with visual impairments, can use the lift confidently and
          independently.</p>
        <b>Electrical Safety with Residual Current Circuit Breakers</b>
        <p>Electric shock is a potential hazard during lift operation and maintenance activities. To protect residents,
          users, and maintenance personnel, a safe power supply system is installed for the lift, incorporating residual
          current circuit breakers (RCCBs) with overload protection. These safety devices are applied to the lighting
          power circuits within the lift car interior, lift shaft, and at both the top and bottom of the lift car,
          effectively reducing the risk of electric shock and enhancing overall safety.

        <b>Anti-Hand Trapping Devices on Lift Doors</b>
        <p>An anti-hand trapping device is installed on the lift doors to automatically stop their operation if a
          passenger’s hand is detected in the door gap, preventing injury and enhancing user safety.
        </p>
        <b>Infrared Non-Contact Lift Door Detection</b>
        <p>A non-contact detection system using multiple infrared beams is installed near the lift doors to sense the
          presence of objects or individuals. This system enhances safety by preventing the doors from closing whenever
          an obstruction is detected, thereby reducing the risk of injury to residents and users.
        </p>
        <b>Escalator Safety with Warning Stripes</b>
        <p>Accidents caused by slips, trips, or falls can occur while using escalators. To help prevent these incidents,
          a 150mm-wide yellow warning stripe is painted along the three edges of each step and the top edge of the
          apron. This visual alert enhances awareness for passengers and maintenance workers, promoting safer use of the
          escalator.

        <b>Safety inside Plant Rooms</b>
        <p>To provide safe working environment for the maintenance workers, all mechanical moving parts of the machine
          inside plant rooms should be effectively guarded to avoid bodily contact and prevent injury. Insulated rubber
          mats are also recommended to be placed adjacent to electrical panels/switches for better protection against
          electric shock during maintenance work. For objects such as plinth, kerb, floor trunking etc. protruding from
          the floor/corners which may possess tripping hazards, the objects should be painted with clear and prominent
          colour (such as yellow and black stripes) as warning signs to alert the workers.</p>

        <b>Volume Control Devices for Refuse Chutes</b>
        <p>Refuse Chute is provided for each domestic block with waste collected in refuse bins located in the ground
          floor refuse collection chamber. However, workers may be injured due to hazards arising from overfilled refuse
          bins. To address this safety concern, a Volume Control Storage Device has been incorporated into the refuse
          chute system to regulate the volume of refuse, preventing overfilling and reducing the risk of injury to
          maintenance and refuse collection workers.

        <b>Bin Cleansing Machine for Safe Waste Handling</b>
        <p>The refuse bins used have a capacity of 660 litres, with dimensions approximately 1370 mm long × 775 mm wide
          × 1185 mm high, and weigh around 35kg (net weight when empty). These bins require regular cleaning and
          maintenance to ensure hygiene and safety. Traditionally, workers manually maneuver the bins during washing,
          which demands significant physical effort and increases the risk of strain or injury. To reduce the physical
          burden on workers and enhance safety, a Bin Cleaning Machine has been introduced. This machine automatically
          lifts the bins, making it easier and safer for workers to clean the interior without excessive manual
          handling.</p>

        <b>Safe Access for Slope Maintenance</b>
        <p>Slopes require regular inspection and maintenance to ensure their safety and functionality. To provide safe
          access for workers carrying out these tasks, maintenance paths and staircases are installed at regular
          intervals. These provisions enable workers to perform inspections and maintenance activities safely and
          efficiently, minimizing the risk of accidents during access.</p>
