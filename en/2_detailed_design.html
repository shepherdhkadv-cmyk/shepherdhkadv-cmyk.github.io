        <h2>Main Entrance Gateset Design</h2>
        <p>For the main entrance gateset design, a lighter gateset is adopted to facilitate easier operation and to
          prevent falling hazards, thereby enhancing safety for workers and personnel involved in architectural
          work. Key safety features include the use of an offset pivot hinge floor spring, which ensures smooth
          and controlled gate movement, and the addition of inspection panels for easy maintenance checks.
          High-quality stainless steel fasteners such as screws, bolts, locknuts, thread-locking adhesive, spring
          washers, and safety pins are specified to secure all components reliably. The gateset height is reduced
          to minimise risks associated with handling and operation. Furthermore, a door lock status indicating light
          and clear signage are incorporated to provide immediate visual feedback on the gate’s locked condition,
          improving situational awareness. To prevent accidental gate detachment or collapse, stainless steel
          chains firmly fasten the door leaves to the frame, adding an extra layer of security.</p>

        <h2>Window and Window Grille Safety</h2>
        <p>o enhance the safety of workers and occupants in domestic flats,
          careful attention is given to the design of windows and window grilles.
          The maximum width of the sash for side-hung casement windows is
          limited to 700 mm, which helps prevent excessive weight and reduces
          the risk of accidents during installation and maintenance. An additional
          transom is incorporated below the air-conditioning hood to minimise
          the size of individual glass panels, making them easier and safer to
          handle. All openable windows are fitted with robust window grilles,
          providing a physical barrier that protects against accidental falls
          during cleaning or maintenance activities. For fixed window panels,
          tempered glass is specified to ensure greater resistance to breakage
          and to minimise the risk of injury from shattered glass.</p>

        <h2>Door Design</h2>
        <p>For enhanced accessibility and safety, door designs in domestic flats prioritise the needs of all users. To
          facilitate safe passage for wheelchair users, shallow and beveled curbs are incorporated at flat entrances,
          bathrooms, and kitchens, minimising tripping hazards. Additionally, to promote visual connection and
          communication between individuals of varying heights, kitchen doors are designed with high and low-
          level vision panels.</p>

        <h2>Bathroom Facilities Design</h2>
        <p>To promote a safer environment in bathroom facilities, particularly for residents, specific design
          considerations are implemented. At sunken shower areas, a contrasting colour edge is used to clearly
          highlight any level differences, reducing the risk of trips and falls. This edge is combined with a slip-
          resistant surface, further enhancing safety during use and maintenance. Additionally, grab rails are
          installed in shower zones to provide essential support for the elderly and those with mobility challenges,
          ensuring stability and confidence while moving within wet areas.</p>

        <h2>Electrical and Mechanical Room Protection</h2>
        <p>To minimise the risk of water leakage compromising critical electrical and mechanical equipment,
          careful consideration must be given to the location of electrical and mechanical rooms within a building.
          Wet environments such as water tanks and booster pump rooms should not be situated above essential
          electrical service areas including lift machine rooms, photovoltaic equipment rooms, and emergency
          generator rooms to prevent the possibility of water ingress and subsequent electrical hazards. Where
          such an arrangement is unavoidable, additional protective measures such as a double ceiling slab or
          effective waterproofing with proper drainage should be provided between service rooms. Similarly,
          electrical service rooms and cable ducts should be located away from pipe ducts containing wet services,
          such as fire service pipes, water pipes, and water tanks. If separation is not practicable, waterproofing
          must be applied to the partition walls between these rooms to act as a barrier against potential leaks.</p>
        <div class="single-img-section">
          <img src="/assets/images/process2/image_10.jpeg" loading="lazy" />
        </div>
        <p>To prevent electrical power disruptions caused by water leakage or flooding from burst pipes in water
          pipe ducts or water meter rooms, it is essential to separate rooms designated for electrical services and
          water services as much as possible, either horizontally or vertically. This spatial separation significantly
          reduces the risk of water infiltrating electrical areas and causing hazardous situations for both building
          occupants and maintenance personnel. Where complete separation is not practicable due to site
          constraints, additional protective measures such as robust waterproofing and drainage systems should
          be implemented to further safeguard electrical installations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="line-divider"></div>

        <h2>Twin Tanks Water Supply</h2>
        <p>To ensure a continuous supply of fresh and flushing water during routine maintenance or cleaning, a
          twin tank water supply arrangement is recommended. This design allows one tank to remain operational
          while the other is being serviced, eliminating the need for complete water shutdowns and thereby
          minimising disruption to residents. From a safety perspective, the twin tank system reduces the risk
          of waterborne diseases such as Legionnaire’s disease by facilitating regular cleaning and maintenance
          without compromising water availability. For workers and maintenance personnel, this arrangement
          provides a safer working environment, as maintenance tasks can be carried out without pressure to rush
          or bypass safety procedures due to urgent water supply demands.</p>
        <div class="line-divider"></div>

        <h2>Corridor Finished with Wall Paint</h2>
        <p>To enhance safety and reduce maintenance risks in building corridors, wall paint is recommended as
          a finish instead of wall tiles. This approach eliminates the potential hazard of falling tiles, which can
          occur due to adhesive failure over time. By opting for painted surfaces, the risk of injury to workers,
          maintenance personnel, and building occupants is significantly minimised. Additionally, painted walls
          are easier to maintain and repair, further supporting a safer and more efficient working environment
          within common areas.</p>

        <h2>Structural Safety Innovations <br>
        Precast Concrete Components and Modular Integrated Construction</h2>
        <p>he adoption of Precast Concrete Components
          and Modular Integrated Construction (MiC)
          significantly enhances safety for workers and
          personnel by streamlining the construction process
          and minimising on-site risks. By shifting much
          of the construction work to a controlled factory
          environment, MiC reduces the need for high-
          risk activities such as working at height, manual
          handling of heavy materials, and exposure to
          adverse weather conditions. This approach results
          in better quality control, less construction waste,
          and reduced disturbance to both workers and the
          surrounding community. Recent enhancements in
          MiC design, such as the transition from side fixing
          to top fixing, provide a safe, permanent working
          floor for tasks like rebar fixing, eliminating the need for temporary elevated platforms that can pose
          fall
          hazards. Additionally, upgrading modules from five to six faces increases structural stability, reducing
          the requirement for temporary works inside the modules and further safeguarding workers during
          installation.</p>

        <h2>Standardised Safety Drawings</h2>
        <p>Standard drawings are made available to project teams as essential references, covering a wide range
          of construction elements such as foundation works, precast concrete components, temporary and
          external works including excavation and lateral support, lamp post footings, hoarding plans and Modular
          Integrated Construction modules. These standard drawings provide detailed, proven guidelines that
          promote consistency and quality assurance across projects, while ensuring compliance with safety
          regulations. By following these standardised designs, project teams can more effectively identify and
          mitigate potential hazards, streamline construction processes, and reduce the likelihood of errors
          or unsafe practices on site. This not only improves time efficiency and construction quality but also
          significantly enhances the safety of workers and maintenance personnel by minimising ambiguity and
          supporting safer work methods throughout the project lifecycle.</p>

          Building Services Safety Design <br>
          Multi-Trade Integrated Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing</h2>
        <p>Multi-Trade Integrated Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing (MiMEP) significantly enhances safety for
          workers involved in building services installation, especially for tasks typically requiring work at
          height,
          such as sprinkler valve adjustments, cabling, and pipe installations. By integrating multiple trades into
          prefabricated modules assembled off-site in controlled factory environments, MiMEP reduces the
          reliance on labour intensive, high risk on-site activities. This approach minimises workers’ exposure to
          fall hazards and cramped working conditions, while improving productivity, quality, and sustainability.
          The off-site fabrication and modular assembly enable safer, more efficient installation processes on-
          site, reducing coordination complexity and site congestion.</p>

        <h2>Solar Photovoltaic System Safety</h2>
        <p>To ensure the structural stability and safety of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, each PV module is
          securely fixed to its supports and holding frames using stainless steel bolts and nuts with spring washers
          at a minimum of eight fastening points. This robust fixing method significantly reduces the risk of PV
          modules becoming loose or detached during severe weather conditions, thereby preventing potential
          hazards to maintenance workers and building occupants below. Proper fastening not only enhances
          the overall integrity of the installation but also facilitates safer maintenance and inspection
          activities, as
          workers can be confident in the stability of the modules while working at height.</p>

        <h2>Isolated LV Switchboard Design</h2>
        <p>LV switchboards are designed with isolated
          sections so that maintenance work on one
          section does not disrupt the operation of the
          others. This modular construction allows
          workers to maintain partial electricity supply
          during maintenance, enabling workers to
          perform their tasks without rushing. This
          approach enhances attention to detail and
          improve awareness on safety, significantly
          reducing the risk of accidents, such as
          electrical shocks or equipment mishandling.</p>

        <h2>Water Ingress Prevention</h2>
        <p>Water ingress resulting from burst
          water pipes can create significant
          safety hazards, including the risk
          of electrical shock and damage to
          sensitive equipment. To mitigate these
          dangers, control panels are designed
          with double doors or enclosures to
          provide an effective barrier against
          water entry. This precautionary
          measure helps to protect operators
          and maintenance personnel from
          potential electrical hazards, reduces
          the likelihood of equipment failure, and
          ensures a safer working environment in
          building services operations.</p>

        <p>Clogging of dirt or grit in flushing water pipes can cause a rise in pressure, potentially leading to
          pipe
          bursting and creating serious safety hazards for personnel. To mitigate these risks, bucket-type strainers
          are installed at both the incoming flushing water pipe and the discharge side of the flushing water feed
          pump. This helps prevent debris from entering the system, thereby minimising the chances of flooding
          and reducing the need for manual repair work. Additionally, machine guards are provided to cover the
          moving parts of water pumps, protecting workers from accidental contact and injury during operation
          and maintenance.</p>

        <h2>Roof Access Safety</h2>
        <p>To ensure the safety of workers and maintenance
          personnel when servicing building services
          equipment located on rooftops, it is essential to
          provide permanent working platforms equipped
          with railings, toeboards, and access ladders. These
          platforms offer secure and stable access for the
          repair and maintenance of chillers and cooling
          towers, significantly reducing the risk of falls and
          other accidents. Additionally, dedicated working
          platforms should be installed for the operation and
          servicing of gate valves positioned at high levels. By
          incorporating these safety features into the design,
          safe and easy access is ensured for all maintenance

          structure
          and effectively managing groundwater, these combined techniques increase the slope’s tolerance to
          uncertainties such as heavy rainfall or unexpected loading conditions. This not only reduces the
          likelihood and consequences of slope failure but also significantly improves safety for workers and the
          public involved in geotechnical engineering and maintenance activities.</p>

        <h2>Tree Selection Matrix</h2>
        <p>
          In the detailed design stage of public housing landscape works, the principle of “Right Tree, Right
          Place”
          is rigorously applied to minimise safety risks for both workers and residents. Careful selection of tree
          species, with reference to the findings from micro-climate and ecological studies, ensures that only
          those suited to the specific site conditions such as local climate, soil, and exposure are planted.
          Trees
          chosen for podiums and slopes are matched in size, height, crown spread, and maturity to the physical
          constraints of the area, reducing the need and risk for intensive horticultural work later. Species with
          proven
          resilience characteristics such as shade, drought, wind, soil compaction, and pollution are prioritised
          according to the site constrains, lowering the frequency of plant replacement and maintenance, and thus
          reducing workers’ exposure to risks in horticultural works. <br /><br />
          In areas prone to strong winds, secure guying and supports for trees are provided, with removable eye
          bolts installed along planter walls for safe anchorage, especially during the establishment stage of new
          trees. The design process uses micro-climate data to avoid tree planting in areas with excessive wind
          exposure whenever possible, further safeguarding maintenance personnel from falling branches or
          unstable trees.<br /><br />
          Additionally, to protect both workers and residents, tree, shrub, and climber species with pointed
          leaves,
          toxic parts, or those likely to exacerbate allergies are avoided. This reduces the risk of accidental
          injury
          or health issues during planting, maintenance, and routine care.

          such as green roofs and podium planters in detailed design stage of landscape works greatly enhances
          safety for horticultural personnel. By reducing the reliance on intensive and repetitive manual labour,
          these watering systems not only increase the efficiency of daily maintenance works but also
          significantly
          lower the risk of occupational hazards, including heat stroke from prolonged exposure to direct
          sunlight,
          falls from height when accessing elevated planting areas, and ergonomic injuries from repetitive lifting
          and carrying.</p>

          attention is given to the design, installation, and maintenance of the play and fitness equipment that
          compiles with safety standards. Equipment is strategically installed to maximise play value while
          minimising hazards, with layout designs promoting a safe flow of movement and providing sufficient
          space to prevent collisions, particularly for users with disabilities. All play and fitness equipment
          must
          be inspected and endorsed by an Approved Playground Safety Inspector to confirm compliance with
          relevant safety standards and required safety margins.<br /><br />
          Sufficient seating facilities under shade are provided near play areas for the caregivers, enhancing
          child
          safety supervision, offering shelter from direct sunlight during rest, and encouraging social
          interaction
          for users of all ages. Bilingual warning signs are installed at prominent locations, outlining the
          safety
          precautions and instructions for equipment users, including the suitable age range of use and the age
          range of children using the equipment that require adult supervision.<br /><br />
          All communal play areas are equipped with Impact Absorbing Safety Materials (IASM) as a crucial safety
          measure to protect users from hazards, such as falls from height. The IASM layout design covers the
          necessary safety margins and use zones for each piece of play equipment, and the materials will be
          tested by a recognized laboratory in compliance with safety standards.</p>
