        <h2>Foundation Works Safety</h2>
        <b>Plant and Material Handling</b>
        <p>Effective safety in plant and materials handling is critical in construction works and begins with thorough
          early planning. Proper strategies must be established for the safe storage of materials, careful manoeuvring
          of construction plants, and the secure transportation of heavy or bulky items. These measures help prevent
          accidents, protect workers from potential hazards, and ensure smooth site operations throughout the foundation
          phase.</p>

          <b>Equipment Disposition and Transportation</b>
          Proper disposition and transportation of equipment are crucial for safe piling operations in construction
          works. Before any lifting activities begin, the work area should be securely fenced off, and safety features
          such as CCTV in operator cabins, warning bars, rear cameras, and overload alarms must be in place to enhance
          monitoring and prevent accidents. When lifting heavy casings, using two cranes to maintain horizontal
          positioning rather than relying on a single crane-further reduces risks. These measures collectively help
          protect workers, minimise hazards, and ensure smooth, safe equipment handling on site.

        <h2>Building Works Safety</h2>
        <b>Precast Concrete Components and Modular Integrated Construction Advantages</b>
        <p>The shift from traditional cast-in-situ concrete construction to the use of Precast Concrete Components (PCC)
          and Modular Integrated Construction (MiC 1.0 and MiC 2.0) significantly enhances site safety and creates a
          healthier working environment for construction personnel. By adopting these advanced construction methods, the
          need for extensive formwork and temporary propping on site is eliminated, reducing risks associated with
          working at height, manual handling, and site congestion. Precast and modular components are manufactured in
          controlled factory settings, ensuring higher quality, better hygiene, and fewer on-site hazards. This
          transformation not only improves safety for workers but also supports sustainable construction practices by
          minimising waste and site disturbances.</p>

        <p>The adoption of precast components-such as precast façades, staircases, semi-precast slabs, beams, parapets,
          and water tanks has greatly improved site safety by reducing the need for formwork and temporary propping,
          especially at height. To further protect workers from fall hazards and strenuous site work, volumetric precast
          bathrooms and kitchens have been introduced, allowing much of the complex installation to be completed in
          controlled factory environments. The latest advancement, MiC 2.0, features six-face modules that are
          self-supporting and require no temporary works inside the module, further minimising on-site risks. By
          shifting more construction activities off-site and into safer, weather-protected factory settings, these
          innovations significantly enhance the safety, health, and well-being of workers while also supporting cleaner,
          more sustainable construction practices.</p>

        <b>Plant Age</b>
        <p>To ensure a safe working environment for all personnel, major construction plants such as cranes, hoists, and
          pile drivers must undergo regular inspection and maintenance to confirm they are in proper working condition
          and safe to use. Each type of plant has a maximum allowable age for site use, beyond which it is prohibited,
          ensuring only reliable equipment is operated.</p>

        <b>Lifting Operations</b>
        <p class="item">Lifting operations are a major activity during construction and require careful planning to
          protect workers and site personnel. Early identification and clear demarcation of lifting zones during the
          site planning stage are essential to prevent collisions and ensure safe movement of loads. This is
          particularly important for sites located in urban areas or those with multiple cranes, where the risk of
          interference with adjacent sites or nearby tower cranes is higher. To further safeguard workers, all tower
          cranes are now equipped with advanced anti-collision systems that continuously monitor crane movements and
          provide real-time alerts, effectively minimising the risk of accidents.
          <br>
          To enhance lifting safety and prevent accidents, it is mandatory to use a double chain sling when lifting
          hoppers. This precaution ensures that if one chain fails, the other will securely support the load,
          significantly reducing the risk of dropped loads and protecting workers from potential injury.

          comprehensive safety documentation, including a detailed Safety Plan, safe working procedures, and risk
          assessments for all high-risk activities. These documents must clearly demonstrate that construction
          activities will be conducted in a manner that prioritises worker safety and minimises hazards. </p>
        <b>Safety Plan </b>
        <p>Safety Plan should encompass the company’s safety and health policies, organisational responsibilities,
          safety committee, training programmes, job hazard analysis, control measures, and emergency response
          protocols. Regular review and updating of these safety documents are essential to adapt to evolving site
          conditions and maintain effective risk control. By fulfilling these contractual safety obligations,
          contractors help create a safer work environment, reduce the likelihood of accidents, and ensure compliance
          with both regulatory and project-specific safety standards. </p>
        <b>Housing Authority Safety Auditing System (HASAS) and Housing Authority Lift and Escalator Safety Auditing
          System (HALENSAS)</b>
        <p>Safety Audits have been incorporated as a contract requirement in Building and Engineering contracts of
          Housing Department since 1996. The HASAS and the HALESAS establish a robust and independent framework to

          <b>Surprise Safety Inspection Programme (SSIP) </b>
          The SSIP is designed to enhance worker safety by promoting heightened vigilance and strengthening safety
          management through surprise site inspections conducted by independent safety inspectors. Its primary
          objectives are to elevate occupational safety and health standards on Capital Works New Works Contracts,
          reinforce third-party oversight of contractors’ safety performance-especially regarding the implementation of
          safety controls-and to emphasise the fundamental principle of “Safety First” as an essential component of
          quality construction. During each surprise visit, inspectors assess high-risk activities and physical site
          conditions against stringent compliance criteria, immediately addressing any unsafe acts or conditions to
          protect workers. The inspection process includes direct engagement with site personnel and contractors to
          foster open communication, ensuring that safety issues are promptly identified, documented, and rectified. By
          integrating SSIP scores into contractor performance assessments and incentive schemes, the programme motivates
          continuous improvement in site safety practices, ultimately safeguarding the health and well-being of all
          workers on construction sites.

          <b>Smart Site Safety System Application</b>
          In reviewing the construction accidents occurred in new works in recent years, 4S is readily implemented for
          monitoring high-risk construction activities continuously. This can help uplift the site safety performance
          through early identification of potential dangerous incidents or dangers and taking immediate follow- up
          mitigation actions. The Smart Site Safety System (4S), introduced in 2024 for contracts exceeding HK$30
          million, represents a significant advancement in safeguarding workers and site personnel through the
          integration of cutting-edge technologies. By leveraging virtual reality for immersive safety training, 4S
          enhances workers’ hazard awareness and emergency preparedness before they step onto the site. The Centralised
          Management Platform (CMP) and electronic permit-to-work system streamline the approval process for high-risk
          activities-such as crane operations, hot works, and working at height ensuring only authorised and competent
          personnel are involved. Real-time authentication of equipment operators, access control to hazardous zones,
          and automated alerts for unsafe acts or conditions-powered by artificial intelligence and IoT sensors-provide
          immediate warnings to workers, enabling them to take corrective actions before incidents occur. The system
          also tracks the location and status of personnel, plants, and equipment, and deploys smart monitoring devices
          to continuously assess workers’ health and safety. For confined spaces, dedicated monitoring further protects
          against hidden dangers. By adopting 4S, frontline workers benefit from early detection of potential hazards,
          fostering a proactive safety culture that helps prevent accidents and ensures a safer, healthier construction
          environment for everyone on site.

        <h2>Lift Installation Safety</h2>
        <p>When performing lift installation works, strict safety measures must be implemented to protect workers and
          personnel from hazards associated with unprotected lift well openings and related activities which area
          protection of lift well openings, safety nets inside lift shafts, permit-to-work system, use of metal
          scaffolding and alternative and work restrictions and communication.
          <br>
          For protection of lift well openings, install four-leaf metal doors at lift well openings to prevent falls of
          persons and falling objects. These doors should be lockable from the outside but accessible from inside
          without the need for a key, ensuring emergency egress and security simultaneously.
          <br>
          Install safety nets with mesh sizes smaller than 20mm x 20mm inside the lift shaft at intervals not exceeding
          20 meters. These nets serve as barriers to catch falling objects and protect workers below from injury.

          <b>Electrical Safety Protocol</b>
          To ensure the safety of workers and personnel during electricity supply system installation and maintenance,
          the following safety measures must be strictly observed.
          <br>
          All electrical cables at elevated locations must be firmly fixed and secured to prevent damage that could lead
          to electrical hazards such as electric shock. All circuits and exposed conductive parts must be properly
          earthed. Earth leakage protection devices should be installed on sockets supplying portable equipment to
          quickly detect and interrupt fault currents, reducing the risk of electric shock. Utilize a 110-volt power
          supply for portable electrical equipment where possible to minimise the severity of electric shocks.

          <b>Safety-Optimized Practices in Civil Engineering</b>
          The use of precast concrete manholes in drainage works significantly enhances worker safety by allowing
          manhole structures to be fabricated offsite, thereby minimising the time workers spend in open pits and
          reducing their exposure to hazards such as falling objects and potential soil collapse. Additionally, adopting
          trenchless excavation methods like slurry micro-tunneling further improves safety for both workers and the
          public. This technique uses remotely controlled boring machines to install underground drains and utilities
          without the need for extensive open-cut trenches, which not only minimises surface disruption and traffic
          interruptions but also reduces the risk of ground settlement and accidental cave-ins. Together, these modern
          construction methods are effective in mitigating traditional risks associated with civil engineering drainage
          works, fostering a safer working environment for all personnel involved.

          <b>Safety Requirement for Excavation Works </b>
          Prior to the commencement of road works, comprehensive Temporary Traffic Arrangements (TTAs) must be
          established to minimize the risk of traffic accidents that could result in serious injuries or fatalities.
          These TTAs should be carefully planned in consultation with relevant government departments, approved by the
          appropriate authorities, and closely monitored during implementation. To further enhance safety, contractors
          must collaborate with clients to implement comprehensive safety measures, creating a secure working
          environment for workers and the public.
          <br>
          Key safety practices include the erection of clear publicity boards displaying the project proponent,
          construction duration, and contact information, as well as the display of excavation permits and TTA plans for
          inspection. Continuous barriers should be installed to fence off work zones, accompanied by road hazard
          warning lanterns to alert drivers and pedestrians. The name and contact details of responsible personnel
          should be prominently displayed, and all workers and visitors must wear appropriate personal protective
          equipment.
          <br>
          During excavation works, adequate trench support must be provided for trenches deeper than 1.2 meters, and all
          trenches or holes exceeding 2 meters in depth should be properly guarded according to safety regulations.
          Where necessary, trenches and holes should be securely covered with steel plates or decking, and safe access
          routes, such as staircases with handrails, should be provided. Any ground settlement or damage to nearby
          roads, buildings, slopes, or public utilities should be closely monitored, and immediate action must be taken
          if instability is detected.
          <br>
          Before excavation works begin, underground utilities detection must be conducted to prevent worker injuries
          and avoid damage to existing utilities. This process adheres to all relevant regulations and codes of
          practice, utilising the latest utility records and drawings, and engaging competent personnel to use suitable
          underground utility detection devices, such as pipe and cable locators or ground-penetrating radar to
          determine the routes of underground utilities. In critical areas, trial pits may be used to confirm the exact
          locations of buried services. All works near power cables and gas pipelines must follow the steps outlined in
          the codes of practice issued by the relevant authorities.
          <br>
          To further safeguard the integrity of the road and surrounding infrastructure, settlement monitoring should be
          implemented during excavation and tunneling works. Settlement monitoring points should be established
          according to the monitoring plan, and if ground settlement exceeds predicted values, work should be halted
          immediately for investigation and remedial action.
          <br>
          By strictly enforcing these safety measures and maintaining vigilant supervision, the risks associated with
          road works can be significantly minimised, ensuring the safety and well-being of workers, road users, and the
          public.

          <b>Safety Measures in Geotechnical Works</b>
          Before commencing ground investigation fieldworks and slope works, comprehensive safety measures must be
          implemented to protect workers and minimize risks. This begins with a thorough review of underground utility
          records from relevant utility undertakings, followed by the use of electronic devices to accurately locate
          existing underground utilities. Prior to drilling, inspection pits should be excavated to ensure no unforeseen
          obstructions or hazards are present.

        </div>
        <p>To ensure safety during construction, stable temporary working platforms must be established for secure
          access to sloping areas. All design assumptions should be carefully verified against actual site conditions
          prior to the commencement of works. Additionally, protective guards are mandatory on the rotary parts of drill
          rigs to prevent accidental contact. Strict adherence to these procedures controls risks in ground
          investigation and slope works, foster a safer working environment for all personnel involved.</p>

          <b>Managing Risks and Safety in Arboricultural Works</b>
          Hazards and risks are inherent in all arboricultural works without exception. Arboricultural treatment
          includes tree pruning, removal, transplanting, guying and other establishment works conducted at ground or
          elevated level, often involve the use of machinery, lifting, and working at heights. Therefore, it is
          essential to maintain a safe system of work throughout all work procedures to minimise potential risks to both
          workers and the public.
        </p>
        <div class="single-img-section">
          <img src="/assets/images/process4/image_48.png" loading="lazy" />
          <p>Arboricultural works</p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Workers participating in tree work operations must have relevant training and experiences. Specific personnel
          shall be deployed to conduct specific types of works, such as tree climber and chainsaw operator, and to be
          supervised by a competent personal, for instance, a Tree Work Supervisor, to ensure that the work is carried
          out in accordance with good arboricultural practice and adequate occupational safety and health measures,
          including procedures outlined in the safe system of work.
          <br>
          When work is conducted at height, appropriate access equipment such as elevating work platforms, podium steps,
          or ladders should be utilized as the safe method for access and support. Aerial tree work by climbing should
          only be undertaken when necessary, and it must be carried out by a qualified Tree Climber under the
          supervision of a Tree Work Supervisor.
          <br>
          When tree work is performed at public area, the Tree Risk Assessors should conduct risk assessment on the
          potential hazards, evaluate the risks and formulate the most appropriate and safe method to carry out the tree
          work. Appropriate safety measures, such as provision of warning signs, cordoning off the work area with
          temporary fencing, and arranging workers to control pedestrian traffic, should be adopted when there is a
          potential risk affecting the public.

        <p>To avoid hazards during maintenance, underground services such as power conduits and manholes should be
          carefully located away from planter areas, and tree planting in confined spaces like small pits should be
          avoided in favour of soil corridors wherever feasible. When considering the planter design, we have to ensure
          adequate space and headroom for air circulation and sunlight penetration, which are critical for healthy plant
          growth and reduce risks associated with pests and disease.
          <br>
          Proper support systems including underground guying, removable eye bolts, and staking should be provided for
          newly planted or transplanted trees to prevent structural failure. Trees should be spaced adequately to avoid
          excessive crown competition, which can lead to weak structures, increased susceptibility to disease and pests,
          and eventual tree failure.
