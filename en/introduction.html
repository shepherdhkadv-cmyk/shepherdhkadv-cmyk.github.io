        <p>The Pictorial Guide was first published in 2010 to promote good practice in planning and design for safety in
          project life cycle. This edition aimed to include more examples of Hong Kong Housing Authority projects on
          planning and design of safety built up in past few years and to present the latest practice of our safety
          considerations for a development throughout the stages of design, construction, hand-over for intake and
          occupation, management, and maintenance. The Pictorial Guide can be downloaded from the Hong Kong Housing
          Authority Site Safety Website: www.housingauthority.gov.hk/sitesafety or by scanning the QR code.</p>

          Construction (MiC) and Multi-trade Integrated Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing (MiMEP) in public housing
          development exemplify the approaches of the Hong Kong Housing Authority to eliminate and mitigate the risks of
