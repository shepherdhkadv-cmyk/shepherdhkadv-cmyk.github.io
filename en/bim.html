        <h2>Application of BIM and Innovative Technology</h2>
        <p>Building Information Modelling (BIM) technology allows professionals in the construction industry to carry
          out planning, design and construction works in a virtual environment, which helps to reduce risks, avoid
          changes and render clarity in project delivery. BIM has been applied and other innovative technologies to
          enhance safety in public housing development by enabling detailed visualisation and simulation of building
          processes, allowing for better planning, risk assessment, and coordination among stakeholders to identify and
          mitigate potential hazards before they occur. We have proactively applied these innovative technologies
          through the project life cycle from planning, design and construction in our projects. </p>

        <div class="cs-bullet no-m">

        <h2>Preliminary Design</h2>
        <b>Geographic Information Systems (GIS)</b>
        <p>HA also integrates the usage of BIM and GIS to provide a virtual platform for project teams to have a
          comprehensive review on the relationship between proposed development and the neighbouring environment. The
          integrated models can be used to conduct virtual site analysis, identifying potential safety hazards and risks
          associated with the site’s geography, topography, and existing structures. BIM-based simulations can help
          evaluate the impact of natural disasters, such as flooding, on the proposed site, enabling appropriate
          decisions to be made during the planning and design process.

        <h2>Detailed Design</h2>
        <h3>Generative Design</h3>
        <p>Generative Design is a progressive design process that uses computational techniques and artificial
          intelligence to automate the generation of feasible design options based on specific goals and parameters,
          which can enhance the analysis and decision-making process. This methodology is applied in the HA-developed
          “BIM-enabled Systematic Approach to Foundation Design” (BIM-SAFD).</p>
        <br>
        <b>Foundation design (BIM-SAFD)</b>
        <p>BIM-SAFD is an innovative foundation design approach that provides a comprehensive automatic generation
          solution for foundation design. It enables visualisation of the spatial arrangement of pilings and
          drill-holes, which can help improve the construction safety by identifying hazards before they become
          problems, and avoid physical risks by visualising and planning site logistics ahead of time.

          Systems (MMS), and BIM streamlines the transplantation process by providing spatial data for analyzing the
          optimal orientation of trees. This technology reduces reliance on laborers and minimizes the risk of personal

        </div>
        <p>In recent years BIM is used to conduct extensive pre-construction studies and verification to ascertain the
          buildability of our designs, minimise risks and enhance construction and safety planning so that problems can
          be solved and risks can be mitigated before actual work is carried out on site. As a start, we focus on tender
          stage which has proven to bring significant benefits.
          <br>
          In the past, contractors submitted traditional 2D plans and bar chart schedules as part of the technical
          proposal for complex building and foundation tenders, which were difficult to visualise. Starting from 2020,
          contractors are requested to submit simulation (4D modelling) videos that illustrate the construction process,
          demonstrate construction planning, and identify potential risks. With the simulation videos, the construction
          works and sequence can be clearly demonstrated, allowing project teams to assess whether the contractor has an
          accurate understanding of the work involved and if their construction program is feasible. The benefits are
          especially significant in complex projects with congested sites.

          limited time for the construction of the project.

        <b>Safety</b>
        <p>The site for this project is very congested and in close proximity to existing domestic blocks and MTRC light
          rail. To prevent obstruction of the ground floor during the construction process, a temporary tunnel with
          portal frame will be erected to maintain the vehicle access during the construction of mezzanine floor and
          transfer plate of a domestic block. To prevent object falling to the light rail, protective canopies will be
          erected before commencement of 1/F. The timing and the extent of these safety measures planned by the
          contractor were demonstrated clearly in the video.

        <b>Risk Mitigation</b>
        <p>The simulation video demonstrates that the contractor for this project decided to excavate and build the
          basement carpark as early as possible to minimise the risk of falling objects during frequent lifting
          operation during the construction of typical floors.
          <br>
          By reviewing the height of cranes and the adjacent buildings and slopes in the simulation video rather than
          just reviewing on a 2D layout plan, luffing cranes were selected to minimise the risk of collision between the
          cranes and the surrounding buildings and slopes.

        <b>Assist Tender Assessment</b>
        <p>The simulation video is an efficient visualisation tool to assist the tender assessment on the contractors’
          proposals. It demonstrates the construction works sequence in 3D and corresponds with the master programme,
          which helps eliminate misunderstandings. Assessment could be made easily with the simulation video on whether
          the proposal was logical and realistic, and whether the contractor has sufficient understanding on the site
          and its constraints.

          proceed planning in a logical manner by maximising the work efficiency of subcontractors.

        <b>Demonstration of Innovative Technology</b>

          added dimension of time could clearly demonstrate the installation, buildability and safety of construction,
          including the MiC modules and components in contractor’s planning and sequencing. The simulation video could
          facilitate contractor to manage and track delivery and storage of MiC components/modules throughout each step
          of manufacturing, packing, logistics and delivery.

        <h2>BIM Use in Construction</h2>
        <p>The use of BIM can enhances the anticipation of some key factors. It allows an evaluation of safety
          considerations from the workers’ viewpoint, ensuring their well-being during construction. Additionally, it
          can addresses public concerns by offering clear insights and visualising the project impacts on the community.
          BIM also facilitates a better understanding of the interaction between workers, machinery, and preserved
          trees. Furthermore, it clarifies the relationship between time and working space, optimising project
          efficiency, and aids in validating existing construction planning to fosters informed decision-making</p>

        <h3>Early Fault Detection by Internet of Things (IoT) Monitoring</h3>
        <p>Continuous monitoring of temperature and humidity levels in plant rooms is crucial for maintaining optimal
          operating conditions. By detecting abnormal fluctuations, the system can alert operators to potential
          overheating, allowing for immediate intervention to prevent equipment failure and reduce the risk of fire
          hazards.
          <br>
          Early detection of water leaks is crucial for preventing electrical hazards that can endanger personnel and
          damage equipment. By identifying leaks promptly, the system ensures a safer working environment and minimises
          costly repairs.
          <br>
          Low-level monitoring of water tanks is essential for ensuring safety and operational efficiency. By promptly
          detecting low water levels, the system alerts staff to take immediate action, preventing potential hazards and
          minimising the risk of equipment damage due to insufficient water supply.
          <br>
          Door status monitoring is essential for preventing unauthorized access to plant rooms, thereby enhancing
          safety and ensuring that only authorised personnel can operate critical systems.
